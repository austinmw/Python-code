To use this environment, you need to activate it, which you can do by typing the following command that calls the activate script:

$   source my_env/bin/activate


Note: Within the virtual environment, you can use the command python instead of python3, and pip instead of pip3 if you would prefer. If you use Python 3 on your machine outside of an environment, you’ll need to use the python3 and pip3 commands exclusively, as python and pip will call an earlier version of Python. 



To leave the environment, simply type the command deactivate and you’ll return to your original directory.
