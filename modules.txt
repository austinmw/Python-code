# this goes in mystuff.py
def apple():
	print "I AM APPLES!"
Once I have this code, I can use the module MyStuff with import and then access the apple function:

1
2
import mystuff
mystuff.apple()
I could also put a variable in it named tangerine:

1
2
3
4
5
def apple():
	print "I AM APPLES!"

# this is just a variable
tangerine = "Living reflection of a dream"
I can access that the same way:

1
2
3
4
import mystuff

mystuff.apple()
print mystuff.tangerine
